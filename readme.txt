behavior: Counter should be a class that has public functions:
	-add_one() (adds 1 to internal counter), 
	-subtract_one() (removes 1 from internal counter) , 
	-reset() (sets internal counter to 0), 
	-and get() (returns current count value). 
-the internal count variable must be private.
-Count must start at 0.
